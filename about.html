The Dept. of Computer Applications was established in 2009, and since then we have been empowering graduates in Engineering, Science and Commerce, to meet the challenges of the fast- growing sphere of technology. The major thrust of the programme is to provide students a sound background in computing, business functions and mathematics which are relevant to Information technology.
